### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Patoary
#### Web Developer


Iâ€™m a Front End Web developer who is passionate about making error-free websites with 100% client satisfaction. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as publicly as possible. I love to solve real-world problems. I am strategic, goal-oriented, and always work with an end goal in mind. Most of the time I work with WordPress but some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, JavaScript as well as Node.

Skills: JAVASCRIPT / REACT / NODE / EXPRESS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node
